## Dev Rules (for AI agents)

1. Each change MUST include Playwright e2e tests
2. Run ALL tests after each change (`npx playwright test`)
3. Build and verify (`npm run build`) before committing
4. Read existing source files before modifying — understand the patterns
5. Keep the app generic — no personal names or hardcoded baby info
