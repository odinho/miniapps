## Flaky E2E: `dashboard.e2e.ts:165` — Redirects to settings when no baby exists

**Status:** confirmed pre-existing (fails on plain `main` HEAD; reproduces with
`bun run test:e2e tests/dashboard.e2e.ts` — passes solo).

**What it does:** navigates to `/`, expects the `Velkomen til Babysovelogg`
heading to be visible. The fixture's [`autoResetDb`](../tests/fixtures.ts) is
supposed to clear `baby` so the redirect-to-settings flow fires, but when this
test runs after other tests in the file (which create babies), the assertion
times out at the heading lookup — implying state from a prior test bleeds in,
likely via a race between the optimistic in-flight `POST /api/events` and the
fixture's reset, or a shared SSE stream that's still emitting state with a baby
attached.

**Plan:**
1. Add `await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle")` after `page.goto("/")` to
   let any in-flight SSE state from prior tests settle, then re-assert.
2. If still flaky, make `resetDb()` synchronous via a dedicated test endpoint
   that closes broadcast channels before clearing tables, instead of relying on
   raw SQL deletes that race with open SSE connections.
3. Pin: run the full `dashboard.e2e.ts` 5 times in a row in CI as a smoke
   check — if it passes 5/5 it's stable.

**Impact:** low — production is unaffected; the test exercises onboarding and
this scenario is well-covered elsewhere. But "no flakiness allowed" is the
project rule.
